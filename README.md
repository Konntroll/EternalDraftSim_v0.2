# EternalDraftSim_v0.2
An upgraded Eternal Card Game draft simulator implemented using JS, PHP, and MySQL.

Unlike its predecessor, EternalDraftSim_v0.1, this iteration of the program adds another UI element, which enables an overview of the drafted deck and allows the player to tweak and adjust their result by removing cards from the main deck, adding cards from the sideboard, and adding power cards according to the colours of their main deck cards by means of an algorithm that analyses colour ratios in the deck.

The added UI screen also includes two additional pie charts akin to those seen in the game, giving the player at-a-glance information about their deckâ€™s colour distribution and card type composition.

The rest of the software remains largely unchanged disregarding minor tweaks to AI logic and the like. For this reason, this repository only includes the code, but not the assets of the programme so as to make it a bit more compact and manageable in terms of code review.

For full description of the previous version of the project, please see EternalDraftSim_v0.1.
